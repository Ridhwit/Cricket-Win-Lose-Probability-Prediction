# Cricket Win-Lose Probability Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Cricket Win-Lose Probability Prediction** project aims to predict the probability of a cricket team winning or losing based on real-time match data. Using machine learning models trained on IPL match datasets, the app provides an accurate and interactive way to forecast match outcomes. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze factors such as remaining runs, balls left, current run rate, and wickets in hand.
